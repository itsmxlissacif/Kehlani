            <h1>Quotes</h1>
       <p>“I used to think that love was giving up everything of yourself and giving it to the other person. Now, I’ve realized that love is when you have somebody that doesn’t make you give up half of yourself.” </p> 
            
            <p>“You start singing by singing what you hear. So everyone, when they first start singing, they naturally are singing like whatever they’re hearing, because that’s the only way you learned how to sing. So when I was growing up on Lauryn Hill, when I started singing her songs, I literally trained my voice to be able to do runs.” </p> 
            
 <p>"I think, as musicians, our music should be who we are. Sometimes it’s not – it’s someone else’s. All heartfelt music and all honest music, it’s who we are. Of course, our upbringing has everything to do with it." </p>
